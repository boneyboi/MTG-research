#Add one announcement per line
IKO Release. Sorry Companions and Mutate will take some more time. They are still very much on the radar.
We believe the issue with 1.8.0_211 or greater have been resolved. Let us know if you are still on the latest version and things are better now.
[b]Forge now requires Java 8 (or newer). You will not be able to start the game if you are not yet running Java 8.[/b]
We have a Discord server for hanging out with Forge devs and other Forge fans. Feel free to [url=https://discord.gg/3v9JCVr]jump on in and say hi[/url]!
